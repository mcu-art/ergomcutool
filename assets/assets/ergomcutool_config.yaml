general:
  # Path to your ARM C compiler directory

  # Full path to your ARM C compiler

openocd:
  # Define the hardware you use to write data and debug the MCU.
  # The extensive list of supported devices is usually located

  # If the .svd file is included as a part of your project,
  # you should specify it in 'ergomcutool/ergomcu_project.yaml' instead.

# External dependencies are libraries

# This setting is the same as in the 'ergomcu_project.yaml' file,
# but these values have precedence in case of a conflict.
# Note that it is recommended to only specify here machine-dependent paths
# that you are NOT going to commit to the repository.
# Machine-independent paths should be specified as a part of your project
# in the 'ergomcu_project.yaml'.
